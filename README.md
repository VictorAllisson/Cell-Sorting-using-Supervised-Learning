**Introduction**

In molecular and cellular biology, it is widely known that the composition of cells determines their structure, which in turn determines their function. Therefore, cells with different morphologies are likely to have different functions. In this context, the distinction between stem cells and trophoblasts is of great interest. Trophoblasts are cells that make up the outer layer of a developing human embryo, and they have a unique shape that distinguishes them from other cells.

Stem cells and trophoblasts have distinct morphologies and functions. Stem cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate into various cell types and can be found in both embryonic and adult tissues. On the other hand, trophoblasts play a crucial role in the implantation of the embryo and the development of the placenta. Trophoblasts also have a unique ability to invade the maternal uterus, which is essential for successful pregnancy.

To distinguish between stem cells and trophoblasts, various approaches have been used, including protein and genetic expression analysis. However, these methods have their limitations, such as being time-consuming and expensive, requiring a large number of cells, and having low sensitivity and specificity.
Recently, with the advent of deep learning techniques, there has been a growing interest in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify cells based on their morphology. A CNN can learn to extract features from images and use these features to distinguish between different cell types. Using a CNN to classify cells would be time and money-saving, as it requires only a small number of cells, and the analysis can be performed quickly and accurately using a microscope. In this study, we aimed to develop a CNN model to distinguish between stem cells and trophoblasts based on their morphologies.
Implementation of Liu et al., 2021

Based on the mentioned importance of cell morphology and composition, distinguishing between different cell types can provide valuable information for various applications in molecular and cellular biology. In this project, I selected an article that implemented pre-trained neural networks, including DenseNet, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, and Xception, to distinguish between two types of cells: trophoblasts and embryonic stem (ES) cells. The article trained these models using 1500 images and Python language. As part of my project, I adapted their work to Matlab and tested the trained models using my own images, which I collected in my laboratory.
